									<p>The Syncris Internship Project focused on advancing market research and outreach strategies for a clean energy startup developing modular microgrid technology. By identifying and analyzing potential customer segments including rural electric cooperatives, solar resellers, and equipment manufacturers the project built a structured outreach pipeline to explore market demand for decentralized energy solutions. Leveraging tools such as LinkedIn and email campaigns, the team connected with 40+ industry contacts to better understand customer pain points related to grid stability, renewable energy adoption, and energy independence. Through collaborative problem solving and data-driven market sizing, the project defined the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM), estimating a first-year opportunity of $33.75M in the Midwest. With its emphasis on research, strategy, and communication, the internship provided both practical industry insights and measurable contributions to Syncris’ growth initiatives.</p>
